# Project Structure Guide

- The main entry point for routing is [src/App.tsx](mdc:src/App.tsx), which defines all routes using React Router.
- Each main section of the site (Home, About, Experience, Projects, etc.) has its own page component in [src/pages/](mdc:src/pages).
- Project detail pages are implemented as separate components in [src/pages/](mdc:src/pages), for example:
  - [ProjectStakeDetail.tsx](mdc:src/pages/ProjectStakeDetail.tsx) for the Stake.com Bot project
  - [ProjectGmailContactExtractorDetail.tsx](mdc:src/pages/ProjectGmailContactExtractorDetail.tsx) for the Gmail Contact Extractor project
- The projects list is rendered by [src/components/Projects.tsx](mdc:src/components/Projects.tsx), which links to the appropriate detail page for each project.
- Public assets and screenshots are stored in [public/lovable-uploads/projects/](mdc:public/lovable-uploads/projects).
- 404s are handled by [src/pages/NotFound.tsx](mdc:src/pages/NotFound.tsx).
